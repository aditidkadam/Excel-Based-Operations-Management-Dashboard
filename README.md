# Excel-Based-Operations-Management-Dashboard


This project is my attempt to turn raw operational data into actionable insights — all within Excel.  
Using pivot tables, slicers, charts, and calculated metrics, I built a dashboard that brings visibility into delivery performance, department efficiency, and workflow bottlenecks.

##  Why I Built This

Operations data often gets trapped in spreadsheets with no clear direction. I wanted to fix that — by creating a user-friendly Excel dashboard that not only tracks KPIs, but tells the story behind them.  
This tool is built for managers and analysts who want to understand the *“why”* behind the *“what.”*

##  What the Dashboard Reveals

###  1. Department Performance at a Glance  
> **What I Discovered:**  
Each department shows a different level of fulfillment efficiency and delay rate. Some consistently meet targets; others reveal areas of concern.

> **Why It Matters:**  
Comparing departments side by side helps identify where improvements or deeper investigations are needed.

---

###  2. Delivery Timeliness  
> **What I Discovered:**  
Late deliveries were concentrated in specific weeks and departments.

> **Why It Matters:**  
Time-based trends expose recurring bottlenecks, making them easier to address with planning or policy changes.

###  3. Order Flow and Volume  
> **What I Discovered:**  
Peaks in order volumes occasionally misaligned with available capacity — indicating potential pressure points.

> **Why It Matters:**  
This insight supports smarter staffing and inventory planning.
